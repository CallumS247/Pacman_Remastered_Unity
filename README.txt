My project was built on Unity Engine - Version 2022.3.54f1

Download unity hub: https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive  and follow install instructions

In Unity Hub while on the projects tab, select Add in the top right -> add project from disk

(make sure project has been extracted from the .zip file first)
Select the folder called "FYP_w1886669_Final" and project should appear in the list to be opened.

I have deleted the Library folder from my project to reduce file size, so might take a little bit to open while it is rebuilt.
